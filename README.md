# Account-Transactions-Api

I am both watching this [comprehensive course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10yKGY1BIBk) by Folksdev and impelementing the project in the video myself in this repo.  
This API is used for opening a new “current account” of already existing customers.

## Requirements

- The API will expose an endpoint which accepts the user information such as customer id and initial credit values.  
Once the endpoint is called, a new account will be opened connected to the specified customer.  
Also, if the initial credit value is bigger than 0, a transaction will be sent to the new account.

- Another Endpoint will output the user information showing name, surname, balance, and
transactions of the accounts.
